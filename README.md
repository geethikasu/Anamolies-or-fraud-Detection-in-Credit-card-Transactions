# Anamolies-or-fraud-Detection-in-Credit-card-Transactions
Here, I tried to develop a model to detect anamolies using various techniques such as Isolation forest, local outlier factor and SVM's.

I downloaded the dataset from kaggle with this Link here below.

Isolation Forest :
The logic argument goes: isolating anomaly observations is easier because only a few conditions are needed to separate those cases from the normal observations. On the other hand, isolating normal observations require more conditions. Therefore, an anomaly score can be calculated as the number of conditions required to separate a given observation.

Local Outlier Factor :
The LOF algorithm is an unsupervised outlier detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers as outlier samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors.

Support Vector machines :
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane.
